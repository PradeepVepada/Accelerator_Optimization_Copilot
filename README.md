# Accelerator_Optimization_Copilot
Accelerator Optimization Copilot is a simulation platform that optimizes memory hierarchy and compilation for deep learning accelerators. It generates realistic traces for Transformers/CNNs and compares cache policies, showing how an LLM-driven scheduler outperforms LRU by predicting tensor reuse.
